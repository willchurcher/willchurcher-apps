Update TASKS.md with the current progress on apps and setup tasks.

The user may optionally pass notes as an argument: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Read TASKS.md to see the current state.
2. Read CLAUDE.md to see the list of current apps.
3. Ask the user (or infer from $ARGUMENTS) what has been completed or started since the last update.
4. Update TASKS.md accordingly:
   - Check off completed items with `[x]`
   - Add any new tasks or app ideas mentioned
   - Move completed apps to the `## Done` section
5. If an app is now live, update the status in the `## Current apps` table in CLAUDE.md.
6. Summarize the changes made to TASKS.md for the user.
